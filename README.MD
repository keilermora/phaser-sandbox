# Phaser Sandbox

[https://keilermora.github.io/phaser-sandbox/](https://keilermora.github.io/phaser-sandbox/) (Desktop only)

Just a project to test [phaser.js 3](https://www.phaser.io/) with Typescript.

## How to play

* **Arrow keys**: Move character
* **Space**: Some characters can Jump!
* **Num. Keys 1 - 4**: Swap characters with different characteristics.

There is no game at all. Its just a space with testing purposes where you can walk and see the differences between the characters.

* **Link from NES**: can walk in all four directions.
* **Link II from NES**: have gravity a can jump, like in a 2D platform game!
* **Link from SNES**: Not only can walk in all four directions, but also in diagonal!
* **Link from GBC**: It's like the SNES one, but also can detect collisions and try to push walls.

## Development environment

Running
